        Journal Writer script

        Script to add a new service entry in the Cartapacio's 
        journal of the current machine, avoiding the necessity of 
        open and edit the file manually. With the flag '-c' the input is 
        saved formatted as a command (Markdown code syntax).
        With the '-a' flag, the input is appended to the 
        last line, which is useful to edit line with more comments 
        or tags.

        A secondary function ('-e' flag) is echo in the terminal 
        the last lines of the journal.

        Other function is remove ('-r' flag)  the last line of
        the journal, to facilitate its correction.
        
        The journal also has the function to append to the last entry 
        a tag. Using the tag flag ('-t') and the tag name without the 
        index, a tag with the index increased will be added at the 
        final of the last entry. Example: '-t tag' will add 'tag34' if
        the last occurrence of tag 'tag' in the journal was 33. If the 
        name had been never used, uses it and the index 1.
        
        Inputting the flag '-rt' and a tag name is calculated 
        the updated tag index like with the '-t' option, but this time, 
        it is not appended but returned. This option is useful to obtain 
        the tag to update other relative logs. The return include the
        tag name and the tag index, like would be added to the journal.
        
        The new '-st' flag saves a new entry that immediately tags. '-st' 
        refers to save and tag. It is used to collapse this very common 
        operation in an unique call which reduces that possible problems when a
        lot of calls exist in a small space of time. The first chunk still a 
        space after the flag will be the tag, and the rest of the line, 
        the entry.

        Only the first param will be considered as a flag.
